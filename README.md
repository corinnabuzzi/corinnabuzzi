# Hi there!
Welcome to my GitHub space dedicated to sharing my self-directed learning journey.  

Here I will upload notes, exercises, projects, and certificates from the courses and materials I work through, with the goal of tracking progress, demonstrating commitment, and building a public knowledge archive that may also be useful to others.

# About me
I’m a software development student with a humanities-oriented academic background, currently transitioning into computer science through formal training and self-directed study. This repository consolidates that transition into a single, structured workspace.


## Purpose
This repository serves three main functions:
1. **Portfolio & Evidence of Practice**  
   Projects, exercises, and experiments that demonstrate applied skills rather than isolated theory.
2. **Learning Documentation**  
   Notes, summaries, diagrams, and conceptual write-ups capturing both understanding and gaps as they emerge.
3. **Accountability & Open Sharing**  
   A public structure that encourages consistency and makes the learning process visible and inspectable.
The purpose of this repository is not to present polished or finished products, but to maintain a transparent, evolving record of how skills are developed over time: what I study, what I build, what breaks, and what improves.

## Status
This is a living repository.  
Expect incomplete work, refactors, changing conventions, and visible iteration over time.
Stability is not the goal. Traceability of learning is.

## What you’ll find here:
- **Study Roadmaps & Progress Tracking**  
  Learning plans, milestones, and evolving skill maps as priorities shift.
- **Technical Notes & Documentation**  
  Structured notes, key concepts, and summaries derived from courses and self-directed study.
- **Assignments & Practice**  
  Public versions of exercises, challenges, and tutorials completed during training.

## Currently working on
*(To be updated)*  
Planned starting points include:
- Harvard's [Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/) - notes found [here](https://github.com/corinnabuzzi/cs50p)
- Python Crash Course, by Eric Matthes
- Frontend programming through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript), focusing on the JavaScript path.
