# Hi there!
Welcome to my GitHub space dedicated to sharing my self-directed learning journey.  

Here I will upload notes, exercises, projects, and certificates from the courses and materials I work through, with the goal of tracking progress, demonstrating commitment, and building a public knowledge archive that may also be useful to others.
# About me
I’m a software development student with a humanities-oriented academic background, currently transitioning into computer science through formal training and self-directed study. This repository consolidates that transition into a single, structured workspace.
## Purpose
This space serves three main functions:
1. **Portfolio & Evidence of Practice** : projects, exercises, and experiments.
2. **Learning Documentation**: notes, summaries, diagrams
3. **Accountability & Open Sharing**: a public structure that encourages consistency and makes the learning process visible and shareable.
The purpose of this is not to present polished or finished products, but to maintain a transparent, evolving record of how skills are developed over time: what I study, what I build, what breaks, and what improves.
## Status
This is a living set of repositories.  
Expect incomplete work, refactors, changing conventions, and visible iteration over time.
Stability is not the goal. Traceability of learning is.
## Currently working on
*(To be updated)*  
Planned starting points include:
- Harvard's [Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/) - notes found [here](https://github.com/corinnabuzzi/cs50p)
